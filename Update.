i have downloaded vpt7 and have made my piece to projects onto. 

I have also spray painted the piece black so the #D effect could be exaggerated.
VPT7 looks easy and seems to be the key to avoiding to much complication trying to 
avoid heavy math for the projection. 

However, the program is running on my old laptop and is 
a little slow, well see what happens when I give it some food. 
I realized now that making things layered in vpt7 is not the way to go. 

I believe the way to complete this project is to make my files in premier.
there are 12 surfces to my piece, and if I make the 12 files in premier or another editing software
then I will be able to export to VPT7 and project. some issues with this
are that the surfaces will be limited with interaction, but I have been thinking that
color swatches may be the answer to this. by organizing the surfaces to the color swatches 
and creating a scale, it will appear to be as one. 

This project is requiring some heavy division.
